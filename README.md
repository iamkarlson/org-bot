# Brain telegram bot

Dumps sent messages to github. Allows to search through them and get some random stuff like pages.

# Why

Because Emacs sucks on mobile and I want to capture my thoughts on the go.

# Deploy
1. Create a bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Fork this repo
3. Fix variables.tf (put them in damn secrets)
4. Run `deploy_terraform.sh`
5. Send your damn messages to your bot
